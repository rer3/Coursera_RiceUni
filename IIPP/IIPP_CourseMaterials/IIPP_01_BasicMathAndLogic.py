-# Python Test 1
# Basic Math and Logic

# Initialize, declare, and print variables like so:
my_var = 5
my_var2 = 'Hello'
print my_var, my_var2

# Note that var naming convention for Python prescribes underscores between words
# The print function does not require parentheses

print 3 + 4
you = "you!"
print "hi there,", you

# Comments are like R
# Algebraic operators are the same
# As are equality and increment/decrement

print
i = 1
print i
++i
print i
++i
print i
print ++i
print

# Note that ++ did not increment i
# Let's name a bunch of variables and go crazy

a = 1
b = 2
c = 3
print a + b + c
print a * b * c
print a / b / c
print a - b - c
print a % b % c
print

# Let's try some logical expressions

print 3 + 4 == 7
print 9/3 == 3
print 9 - 4 == 5
